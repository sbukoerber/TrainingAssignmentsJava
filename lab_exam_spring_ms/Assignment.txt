In this lab assignment you have two services namely empapp and deptapp.
 The empapp service will be used to get the and employee  details by providing employee name
 and the deptapp service will be used to get the deptartment details by providing employee name.

 You can invoke the deptapp services as follows:
 
 http://localhost:8083/departments/IT
 
 It will return the following response:
 {
  "id": 1,
  "deptName": "IT",
  "deptLocation": "BTM"
}

 similarly you can invoke the empapp service to get employee information along with his dept information

 You can invoke the empapp services as follows:
 
http://localhost:8084/employees/Raj

 It will return the following response:
 

{
  "employee": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Raj",
    "salary": 10000.0,
    "deptName": "IT"
  },
  "department": {
    "id": 1,
    "deptName": "IT",
    "deptLocation": "BTM"
  }
}

In this application we have alreay applied feignclient to call deptapp microservice to get inforation
about deptartment of the employee

step 1: we are using hard coded url while using open feign. 
we should use eureka server instead of calling directly


step 3: . we should apply spring cloud gateway so that all 
 request will go through gateway


step 4: Provide some fallback respone using resilence 4j
 in case of coupon service is down

Ports:
deptapp: 8083
empapp: 8084
eureka: 8761
api-gateway: 8090
