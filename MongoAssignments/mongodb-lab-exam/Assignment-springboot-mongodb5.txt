Spring boot mongodb join CRUD application:
----------------------------------
DBRefs (Database References) are a way to store references to documents 
from other collections in MongoDB. 
They are essentially a small embedded document that contains the _id of the referenced document, 
the collection name, and optionally, the database name.
They provide a simple method for referencing documents across collections,
 
In this lab exam you need to create relationship between JournalEntry and User.
One user can have multiple JournalEntry entries. We want to store JournalEntry of each User in a seperate collection

1. Apply suitable annotation to establish relationship between JournalEntry and User and popluate some data to 
verify it
2. apply index on name of user so that searching on basis of name should be faster
3. create rest endpoint for User to do CRUD operations
4. create rest endpoint for JournalEntry to do CRUD operations
5. we want rest endpoint to provide all the JournalEntry of an specific user
